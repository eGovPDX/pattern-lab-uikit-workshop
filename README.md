# UIKIT WORKSHOP

This is a fork of Pattern Lab's Uikit-Workshop theme, v5.7.1. Pattern Lab is a component library tool that lets
renders twig templates with dummy data. This forked version of the Uikit-Workshop theme is prebuilt and has had
its source files, build tools, and dependencies removed. This was done to reduce the dependencies required by
any projects using this tool.
